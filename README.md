# Webscraping projects

Serves as general examples or projects where data can be gathered from web-available sources which don't provide an easy interface (API, downloadable csv or xls files, etc.)

Subprojects will be listed in folders as they are created but most will use only **XML** and **RCurl** for data gathering. 

## POM
